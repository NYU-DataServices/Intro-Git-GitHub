                    <p>GitHub is an easy way to collaborate with others on shared Git repositories. GitHub will host it for us, and we can then sync our local copies with changes made and pushed to the share one.</p>
                    
                    <p>It's also kind of a standard now...</p>

                            <ul><li>If not, please go ahead and <a href="https://github.com/join?source=header-home">make one</a>.</li>

                     <p>There are 2 ways that you can interact with repositories hosted on GitHub: the command line, or if you have Mac OSX and Windows, you can use <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">Desktop GitHub</a>.</p>

                    <p>In our case, since we already have a Git repository initialized, we want to add a remote origin -- this is telling Git where your repository is stored (or going to be stored, in our case!).</p>

					<p>A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.</p>
										
					<p>A pull request is when you want to integrate the changes you made into the original repository you forked. You describe the changes you made and make sure your changes don't conflict with the original repo's code.</p>
