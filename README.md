## Introduction to Git and GitHub

### Description: 
This workshop introduces the basic concepts of Git version control. Whether you're new to version control or just need an explanation of Git and GitHub, this two hour tutorial will help you understand the concepts of distributed version control. Get to know basic Git concepts and GitHub workflows through step-by-step lessons. We'll even rewrite a bit of history, and touch on how to undo (almost) anything with Git. This is a class for users who are comfortable with a command-line interface.

### Topics: 
Git, GitHub, command line, version control.

### Thank You
A big big thank you to [Andy Mueller](https://github.com/amueller), who originally taught this class at NYU and taught me all I know about Git and GitHub! These slides are heavily influenced by his previous class materials, [found here](https://github.com/amueller/git_workshop).


I am not cut out for coding. I'm afraid this is beyond my wheelhouse. But I will keep trying
